    Loads the data from `directory`, which should hold subdirs
    for each "problem"/author in a dataset. As with the official
    PAN datasets, all `unknown` instances for authors are included
    as test data; the rest is used as training data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    directory: str, default=None
        Path the directory from which the `problems` are loaded.
    ext: str, default='txt'
        Only loads files with this extension,
        useful to filter out e.g. OS-files.
    encoding: str, default='utf8'
        Sets the encoding of the files, passed to `codecs.open()`

    Creates a random 50-50 split of the problems represented by
    `train_X`and `train_y`, into an artificially created set of
    development problems and test problems. The number of same-
    author and different-author problems returned is balanced:
    for each true document-author pair, we also include a false
    document-author, whereby we randomly assign a different author
    to the test document in question. There is no document-level
    overlap between the development and test problems created.

    Parameters
    ----------
    train_X : array-like [nb_problems, nb_features], default=None
        The 2D matrix representing a set of documents.

    train_y : list of ints, default=None
        A list of int-encoded author labels (has to be the correct

    random_state : int, default=1027

        correct author, but rather representing a concrete
        verification problem.

    test_gt_scores : list of floats
        A list of ground truth scores (0.0 or 1.0) for the test
        problems returned (X_test, y_test). Each test_gt_scores[i]
