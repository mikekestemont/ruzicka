    """
    Calculates the pairwise "minmax" distance between
    two vectors, but limited to the `rnd_feature_idxs`
    specified. Note that this function is symmetric,
    so that `minmax(x, y) = minmax(y, x)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: float array
        The first vector of the vector pair.
    y: float array
        The second vector of the vector pair.
    rnd_feature_idxs: int array
        The list of indexes along which the distance
        has to be calculated (useful for bootstrapping).

    Returns
    ----------
    float: minmax(x, y)
